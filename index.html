    <h6>About me</h6>
    <p>There is a lot one can say about themselves. The little I can write about me is this-I am a strong and multitalented person currently in Europe enjoying a short stay.My major is computer science. I always wanted to fly a plane as a pilot something that I am still working on. Maybe in a few years who knows. Lord help me on that. We could talk for hours on current trends touching on technology and all the new cryptocurrencies popping up each day. Learning how to play a guitar is in my bucketlist.I am a serious proponent of masculinity and i shun anything that tries to weaken it.</p>

    <h6>uni of wolves</h6>
    <p>My studies were at <a href="http://www.wlv.ac.uk">University of Wolverhampton</a>,a very great institution in West Midlands,England.The University has 3 campuses you can see more at their website. They offer a wide range of courses to choose from. It is well equipped and has been in existence for around 200 years. The city is just a 5 minutes walk.There is also a great community to work with and make the most of your time over there.</p>

    <h6>about coding</h6>
<p>Having majored in computer science,most of the work on my machine is just software and websites stuff. I like the magical feeling that comes with writing code. That moment you think you know but you realise you don't so you google the answers you want.Coding is all fun trying to find a solution to a problem you have or solving another person's issues. Many a times you get requests to fix computers which I can not do myself. The arguments with rookies about whether HTML is a programming language or which framework to use never seems to end in this field.The whole software development is a learning moment as we discover things we did not think were possible in this world.</p>

    <h6>my interests</h6>
    <p>
        Technology and anything that sounds like tech impress me. A.I and software have a good place in my mind and heart for their role in humanity. Imagine this world without computers. Terrible.Lovely supercars and great architecture please me. Talent and enthusiasm in people is a good thing to surround myself with. I love punctuality and I am always on time. Travelling is my hobby. My other hobby is enjoying music-the classic ones. Time is ticking! See you later,bye!
