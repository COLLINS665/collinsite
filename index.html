        <p>Who I am changes depending on who is asking.  I have many personalities. To many I am a friend who comes in time of need, to others I am a their go to bank when they are financially unstable and need some quick loan at a small interest . To the university I am a student, a social one and a good course mate. I am also an enemy to my enemies and a friend to my enemiesâ€™ enemies. I subscribe to positive thinking and being optimistic at all times. </p>
        <p> I spend most time focusing on school work and making sure every second counts. Free times are for a little chit chat here and there and keeping in touch with friends and family. weekends are for assignments and any parties around me.
