        <p>Who I am changes depending on who is asking.  I have many personalities and I unleash each one whenever the time is appropriate. To many I am a friend-a very useful one who comes in time of need to help. Several people have the priviledge to have me as their enemy as well.Occasionaly, who I am depends on external factors like financial situation and the weather.Sometimes I am whoever you heard I am.Most important me is the forgiving and understanding me. I subscribe to positive thinking and being optimistic at all times. </p>
        <p>Free time is for a little chit chat here and there and keeping in touch with friends and family. Weekends are for assignments and getting in touch with nature.

        <p>Coding is an art,where the right mixture of letters of the alphabet and punctuation marks are used to solve real world problems in a manner in which a computer is able to understand,process the mixture and give out a solution.It takes a little time and effort to know the right keys to punch and sit in awe as the machine does it's work and results unfold before your very eyes. The feeling is breathtaking and fulfilling. Yeah coding is fun, you feel nice when instructing the computers to do what you want.</p>
        <p>Code writing is seen as a field of intelligent men and women but truth be told most of the programmers you see do not know what is going on. You have to understand the syntax and have some serious problem solving skills to manage the whole thing. It can be a very rewarding career</p>
